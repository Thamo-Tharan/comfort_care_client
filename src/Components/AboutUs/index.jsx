      <p>They say home is where the heart is</p>

        <p>
          Taking this further, we say the heart is home wherein all your
          furniture is made to cherish
        </p>
        We; at Comfort and Care, have been creating beautiful spaces
        for you within your homes and offices since 1995. With a successful
        start by importing our furniture we came up with our own manufactures
        such as Sofas, Beds and Chairs.
