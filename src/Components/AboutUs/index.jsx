          We at Comfort and Care, have been creating beautiful spaces for you
          within your homes and offices since 1995. With a successful start by
          importing our furniture we came up with our own manufactures such as
          Sofas, Beds and Chairs. Our furniture designs add a premium & stylish
          look to your home & office environment.

            We believe that designs should be exclusive, comfortable and user
            friendly with glamorous aesthetics.
